# Janus Marco Photography and Film Booking System

A simple booking system for my photography services built with Flask. This app allows users to select a photography service, choose a date, and confirm their booking.

## Features

- Service selection (Portrait, Event, Documentary Photography)
- Date selection for available time slots
- Booking confirmation page
- Dark mode styling

## How It Works

1. **Service Selection**: 
   - The user selects one of the photography services (Portrait, Event, Documentary) from a dropdown menu.

2. **Date Selection**: 
   - Once a service is selected, the user is presented with available dates for that service.
   - The user chooses a preferred date for the photoshoot.

3. **Booking Confirmation**: 
   - After selecting the service and date, the user is taken to a confirmation page showing their booking details (service type and date).
   - The user can confirm the booking or go back to make changes.

4. **Dark Mode**: 
   - The app is designed with a modern dark mode theme for a sleek and user-friendly experience.
